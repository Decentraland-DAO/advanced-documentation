**Avatar Pose**
Usually, there are two Avatar Poses that most of artists use
- T-Pose
- A-Pose

Both of this poses have their pros and cons. As you may see, Decentraland Avatar use T-Pose. But, most of newer and well known games use A-Pose, because it's much flexible for creating complex animations, as well as creating complex models with very high topology. 

It's not recommended to create you base and high poly mesh in T-Pose. It's doable way, but you will encounter with baking overlap issues and non-correct shadows on arms and legs of avatar. You will need to use A-Pose for modeling, and in the end, when model will be ready for weight painting, we will change A-Pose back to T-Pose.

First of all, let's change avatar pose from T-Pose to A-Pose.
